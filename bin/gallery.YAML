  This project simulates an order book as seen in stock exchanges. 
  Users can send a “bid” (order to by) or an “offer” (order to sell) with the 
  quantity and price they desire. The system will dynamically match bids and 
  offers that cross (when bid price is >= to offer price) for the desired 
  quantity. The order book will be sorted with most competitive offers 
  at the top and users can view the current order book status with bids and 
  offers, as well as a public leadship board for different statistics. 
  The system will also store a log of all trades that are executed. 
  Users will be able to cancel or modify an order, and display the current book.
